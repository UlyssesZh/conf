# oh-my-tmux

My theme of tmux (modified from the original oh-my-tmux theme).

The theme fits with both light bg and dark bg,
and only use basic colors and ASCII chars to fit with tty env.

## Installation

First, [install tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux#installation).

Next, [install oh-my-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux#installation).

Finally, override `~/.tmux.conf.local` with `.tmux.conf.local` here.
