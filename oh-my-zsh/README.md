# oh-my-zsh

My conf for oh-my-zsh.

Plugin `zsh-syntax-highlighting` is enabled.

The `ulyssesys` theme is a modified version of
[ys](https://blog.ysmood.org/my-ys-terminal-theme).

Some zsh features like auto correction are enabled.

# Installation

First, [install zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).

Next, [install oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install).

Next, [install zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh).

Then, copy `ulyssesys.zsh-theme` into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`.

Finally, override `~/.zshrc` with `.zshrc` here.
