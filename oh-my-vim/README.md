# oh-my-vim

This is my conf of vim editor.

The color scheme `ulysses-koehler` is modified from
[koehler](https://github.com/rodnaph/vim-color-schemes/blob/master/colors/koehler.vim)
and fits with both white bg and black bg and only uses basic colors to fit with tty env.

To fit with tty env, the vim-airline theme is changed to `base16`,
and some of the airline symbols are modified.
